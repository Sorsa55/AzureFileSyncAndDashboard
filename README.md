# AzureFileSyncAndDashboard

Small File Sync for azure file share in storage account and dashboard for that aswell
This was my school work and kinda interesting setup
You need AzCopy for this
How to use

1. Donwload AzCopy from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10
2. Put its path into EnviorementalVariables path
3. Make storage account and inside that make fileshare
4. Download scripts. Scripts folder goes into root directory (For example for me its "C:/scripts"
5. then make also empty folder inside the root
6. in scripts use that empty folder as source
